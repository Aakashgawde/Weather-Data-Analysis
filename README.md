# Weather-Data-Analysis
In this project, I embarked on a journey through the realms of data to extract meaningful insights from weather data. Leveraging Python's powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, I navigated through the complexities of weather patterns to uncover valuable trends and predictions.

First, I meticulously preprocessed the data, handling missing values and transforming the dataset for analysis. Then, utilizing Ridge Regression, I developed a predictive model to forecast maximum temperature (Tmax) for future days. Through rigorous backtesting and evaluation, the model showcased promising accuracy in predicting Tmax values.

But the exploration didn't stop there! I delved deeper, implementing rolling and expanding mean calculations to capture dynamic trends in Tmax, Tmin, and precipitation (PRCP) over varying time horizons. Additionally, I engineered features such as monthly and daily average temperature and precipitation, enriching the dataset for more comprehensive analysis.

The journey was filled with challenges and triumphs, from debugging code to fine-tuning model parameters. Yet, with perseverance and dedication, I successfully crafted a robust data-driven solution that holds immense potential for diverse applications, from agriculture to urban planning.
